# Supply Chain Management 

## Overview

This project is for optimizing products manufacturing, and enhancing transportation systems. Also, focus on products and supplier management. Improve Warehouse productivity is mandatory. 

## Dataset

**Total Records:** 103 (limited)

**Columns:** 24

## Data preprocessing:

- Import necessary libraries and load dataset on Jupyter notebook 
- Checking Data columns and null values. Delete some columns and fill null values with perfect 
match of those data. 
- Then dealing with some duplicates data.

## Key Findings:

**Supplier Analysis:** Supplier 1 has the shortest lead time, making it ideal for quick restocking, while Supplier 3 has the longest. Suppliers 1 and 2 offer moderate shipping costs, whereas Supplier 5 has the highest. Air transport is the preferred mode for urgent shipments, while rail is used for bulk deliveries.

**Product Analysis:** Skincare items are the most expensive, while cosmetics have the highest stock levels and production volume. Haircare products have the highest failure rates, affecting availability, while skincare has the longest manufacturing lead time, contributing to its lower stock levels.

**Transportation Analysis:** Air transport is the fastest and safest, but costly, while road transport has the highest defect rate. Bangalore, Delhi, and Mumbai frequently use air transport for high-priority shipments, while rail and sea are used for non-urgent deliveries.


## Implications:

**Prioritize Supplier 1 for urgent restocking** and explore cost-effective bulk orders from Supplier 3.

**Optimize transport modes** to balance cost and speed, using air for high-value/urgent shipments and rail/sea for bulk orders.

**Improve stock levels for skincare** by addressing manufacturing lead time and demand fluctuations.

**Enhance quality control for haircare products** to reduce failure rates and maintain availability.
